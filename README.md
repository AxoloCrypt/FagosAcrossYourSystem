Fagos Across Your System it’s an 8-bit shoot ‘em up game where you are a Fago in a microscopic world and the system you live it’s invaded by multiple bacteria and another weird thing. 
To survive you must shoot your DNA to these enemies to prevent the total infestation of the system, but be careful, the enemies are going to defend themselves!
