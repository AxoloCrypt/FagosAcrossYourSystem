## Things to keep in mind when contributing
- Mantain respect between users.
- Keep the theme of the game. It's an 8 bit shoot'em up where you represent a Bacteriophage in a microscopic world, you can see more information about Bactheriophages [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriophage).
- Use mainly the pyxel retro game engine. As a contributor you can use another game engine for python or another language, but specify why its implementation and how it benefits.
- If you find a bug or problem in the game feel free to reported on Issues.
